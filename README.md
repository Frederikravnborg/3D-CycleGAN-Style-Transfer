# Deep Style Transfer of Point Clouds using CycleGAN

The project explores the potential of CycleGANs in the relatively uncharted territory of 3D style transfer, building upon the existing progress in 2D style transfer and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The CycleGAN model is trained using FoldingNet as the generator and PointNet as the discriminator. 
The results show a successful style transfer between the sexes from the "Body Model" dataset.
